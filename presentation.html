# What is Functional Programming

* Pure functions
* Immutable data
* Higher-order functions
* Strong types (maybe)
* Only math geniuses allowed

???
Lambda calculus, referential transparency, side-effect free.

Preference for data manipulation over mutation.

Functions that take functions as arguments, functions as values.

not just static types.

---

# Actions vs Values (1)

```javascript
class Customer {
    name = "Donald";
    getName() { return name; }
    /* action          value */
}
```

???
how many on ES6 or similar?

Rich Hickey, Clojure

Most (all) programs are I/O with a hell of a lot of data manipulation in between

Start thinking less about what we want to do and more about what we want to get


---

# Actions vs Values (2)

```javascript
class Customer {
    name = "Donald";
    getName() { return this.name; }
    // action         value! value
}
```

???
except for the implicit value of the customer object

---

# Actions vs Values (3)

```javascript
const donny = {name: "Donald"};
const getName = customer => customer.name;
      // action             value    value  

const getProp = prop => obj => obj.prop;
const getName2 = getProp('name');

getName(donny); // 'Donald'
getName2(donny); // 'Donald'
```

???
explicit values/parameters

focus on structure, not state

It's not that using the word Class makes you a bad programmer; it just makes you a bad person.

currying and composability

## Stop wondering what this `this` is

???
more true of JS than any other (popular) language

---

# The Incredibly Powerful For (1)

```javascript
const list = [..];

for (let i=0; i < list.length; i++) {
    // whatever the hell you feel like
}
```

---

# The Incredibly Powerful For (2)

```javascript
const list = ['1','2',..];

for (let i=0; i < list.length; i++) {
    list[i] = Number(list[i]);
}
```

Turn list of strings into numbers

---

# The Incredibly Powerful For (3)

```javascript
const list = [1,2,..];
const evens = [];

for (let i=0; i < list.length; i++) {
    if ( list[i] % 2 === 0 ) { evens.push(list[i]); } 
}
```

Filter out odds

---

# The Incredibly Powerful For (4)

```javascript
const list = [1,2,..];
const sum = 0;

for (let i=0;, i < list.length; i++) {
    sum += list[i];
}
```

Add it up

---

# The Silver Bullet: Map-Filter-Reduce

```javascript
Array.prototype.map
Array.prototype.filter
Array.prototype.reduce
```

???
ES5

Constraints

Use the power you need to get the job done and no more

# Map: Wrapped Value in, Wrapped Value out (1)

```javascript
const list = ['1','2',..];
const nums = list.map(s => Number(s));
console.log(nums); // [1,2,..]
```

"90% of iterator operations are probably maps" -- Me

???

---

# Map: Wrapped Value in, Wrapped Value out (2)

```javascript
const list = ['1','2',..];
const nums = list.map(Number);
console.log(nums); // [1,2,..]
```

We don't need that lambda

???
point-free style

---

# Map: Wrapped Value in, Wrapped Value out (3)


```javascript
const nums = ['1','2',..].map(Number);
console.log(nums); // [1,2,..]
```

# Filter: Keep Only What You Want (1)

```javascript
const nums = [1,2,..];
const evens = nums.filter(n => n % 2 === 0);
console.log(evens); // [2,4,..];
```

???

---

# Filter: Keep Only What You Want (2)

```javascript
const nums = [1,2,..];
const isEven = n => n % 2 === 0;
const evens = nums.filter(isEven);
console.log(evens); // [2,4,..];
```

Point-free is a little harder but maybe more expressive

???

---

# Filter: Keep Only What You Want (3)

```javascript
const evens = [1,2,..].filter(n => n % 2 === 0);
console.log(evens); // [2,4,..];
```

# Reduce: The Silverest Bullet (1)

```javascript
const nums = [1,2,..,10];
const sum = nums.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
console.log(sum); // 55
```

---

# Reduce: The Silverest Bullet (2)

```javascript
const nums = [1,2,..,10];
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const sum = nums.reduce(add);
console.log(sum); // 55
```

---

# Reduce: The Silverest Bullet (3)

```javascript
const sum = [1,2,..,10].reduce((a, b) => a + b);
console.log(sum); // 55
```

---

# Reduce: The Silverest Bullet (4)

```javascript
const sum = [].reduce((a, b) => a + b); // TypeError
```

```javascript
const sum = [].reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
console.log(sum); // 0
```

---

# Reduce: The Silverest Bullet (5)

```javascript
const customers = [c1,c2,..];
console.log(c1); // {id: 1, name: "Donald"};
```

```javascript
const cmap = {};
for (let i=0; i < customers.length; i++) {
    let customer = customers[i];
    cmap[customer.id] = customer;
}
```

```javascript
const cmap = customers.reduce((m, c) => Object.assign(m, {[c.id]: c}), {});
```

---

# Reduce: The Silverest Bullet (6)

```javascript
const map = f => l => l.reduce((r, e) => r.concat(f(e)), []);

const filter = p => l => l.reduce((r, e) => p(e) ? r.concat(e) : r, []);
```

---

# Map-Filter-Reduce: Bringing it all together

```javascript
const nums = ["1","2",..];

const count = nums.map(Number)
                  .filter(n => n % 2 == 0)
                  .reduce((a,b) => a + b, 0);
```

  * `Array.prototype.*`
  * `Object.entries`
* Many Libraries
  * Ramda
  * Sanctuary
  * Lodash
  * Immutable.js
* Gradual Typing
  * Typescript
  * Flow

#### “To make biological survival possible, Mind at Large has to be funnelled through the reducing valve of the brain and nervous system. What comes out at the other end is a measly trickle of the kind of consciousness which will help us to stay alive on the surface of this particular planet. To formulate and express the contents of this reduced awareness, man has invented and endlessly elaborated those symbol-systems and implicit philosophies which we call languages. Every individual is at once the beneficiary and the victim of the linguistic tradition into which he or she has been born -- the beneficiary inasmuch as language gives access to the accumulated records of other people's experience, the victim in so far as it confirms him in the belief that reduced awareness is the only awareness and as it be-devils his sense of reality, so that he is all too apt to take his concepts for data, his words for actual things.” -- Aldous Huxley

# Functional Programming for the Web (1)

* A "superset" of JavaScript
* Gradual typing
* Many typings available
* Microsoft

## Clojurescript
* Dynamic language
* Lisp
* Much community support

---

# Functional Programming for the Web (2)

## ReasonML
* Ocaml with brackets
* Static types
* Ocaml ecosystem
* Facebook

## Elm
* Haskell inspired
* Strongly-typed
* Language and Framework in one
* Front-end only
* Limited features

---

# Functional Programming for the Web (3)

## Purescript
* Dialect of Haskell
* Strongly-typed, pure, functional language
* The most FP of what's currently available (if you want types)
* Small community
* Used in production by several for-profit companies
